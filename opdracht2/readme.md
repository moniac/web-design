# Introduction

This is a project where the website that I am making will be geared towards people who want to apply for a minor. One of the people I am designing for is deaf and will be giving me pointers on how to make my website more accessible.

## User scenario's

Friend Govand - ICT student
I am a second year ICT student and want to know if the minor Web Development is relevant and challenging for me.

### User needs

* What is the minor?
* What is to be expected of me?
* What will be the subjects?
* What do they teach me?

Marie - Graphic Designer - Deaf

I want the website to be to the point and to get my job done (sign up for the minor).

### User needs

Marie just wants to get her job done without too many complications, she enjoys it if a website is structured properly.

* How can I navigate through?
* What is the least bit of informationt that I need to do my job?

## Breaking it down

It's not a secret that most websites and designs employ a lot of 'visual' noise. Empty/white space gets filled up by either text or graphics.

This means that for my product I will have to find a balance between just enough and too much text.

## User Interface Principles

This section will detail the principles I have tried to incorporate into my design.

1.  **Clarity is job #1**

    The website should immediately convey what it is and what it's for.

2.  **Consistency matters**

    Incorporate the same paddings and margins everywhere, so everything is visually coherent.

3.  **Strong visual hierarchies work best**

    Working with large font sizes, you can help guide the reader to what is important.

Marie initally clicked on this yellow marker, which was intended as a title but looked too much like a button!

A solution would be to make it more obvious that this is just a title.
